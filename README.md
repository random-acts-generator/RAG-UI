## What is Random Acts Generator? 

Random Acts Generator or RAG for short is a simple tool that reminds you and helps you find out different ways on how to be of service to somebody else.

So instead of having to remind yourself and think of yourself RAG helps you half-way into becoming a better person, today. RAG also allows you to add and edit service ideas, so that you never run out of new ways of walking towards the best version of yourself.
We're talking about upgrade!

## My role in the project:

My contribution in this project was to build a modern looking marketing/landing page with the goal of captivating the user into register and using the app.

### What did I do to achieve it?

Well first question I asked was how do I steal the user's attention? After some prototyping (drawing the website in paper) I decided to add very little content but make it captivating, and what is more captivating wise words from wise people? Exactly, Pizza! But since this isn't a website about Pizza I went with the former idea.

So with that idea in mind I decided to have them display in slideshow, transitioning from one quote to another and at first it looked good but was missing something, so I added some sweet animations that smoothe the transition and brings focus to the center of the page.

I wasn't happy still, something was missing, so I though about what RAG really stood for and what it would mean to me if it were something more than a project and I came to the conclusion that what RAG really meant was; Love, Peace and Kindness,

These three words are for and from what the idea was created. The next question was how can I put this into practice?

Well I decided to build a component that would give you a short summary on stance of RAG towards their meaning.

## What did I learn?

The biggest lesson was how to work in a team environment and how communication really makes things a lot easier.
I learned a lot about colors and the importance of them in a website.

As for this update the project is only on its 3rd day so I'm sure I still have something to learn on the next two days
