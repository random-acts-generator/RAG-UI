              <h3>Love</h3>
              <p>Love is the universal language, we see acts of love everywhere if we really want to find them. In animals when a mother tends to her cub, or when the Alpha Lion lets his cubs win so that they grow up with confidence. Love is literally everywhere. Humans, however,they tend to forget to share love because of their busy lives. Our mission is to remind you to spread the seed of life and together shall we see the fruits that the tree of love will give to us.</p>

            <div data-id="2" class="item ">
              <h3>Peace</h3>
              <p>Humans don't function in stress, their brains get foggy with all the hormones and then they do things without even intending on doing them. We all need peace and nowadays in this fast pace world filled with all kinds of different technologies, each one pulling you into a different technology. Justhelp helps you slow down and reconnect with the true essence of reality by participating for the greater good, all by staying in the moment. We all need peace and we all can share some of ours.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-id="3" class="item ">
              <h3>Kind</h3>
              <p>Being kind is a noble act that has become stigmatized, it is seen as weak, but in reality there is no bigger proof of courage and bravery to be kind, being kind opens you to the world, turns you vulnerable and being vulnerable often hurts, but that's the beauty behind it, the strength behind it is enormous. Of course we don't want you to throw yourself to the wolves, so with Justhelp you can gradually become kinder and stronger. Kindness is our greatest bestfriend, especially when it's us that give it out.</p>
